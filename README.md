# FaceMask-Detection
### Workflow

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:

> Data Collection: Gather a dataset of images containing people with and without face masks. This dataset should be diverse and balanced, with images under various conditions (different lighting, angles, backgrounds, etc)
> Data Preprocessing: Resize all images to a consistent size suitable for model input. Normalize the pixel values to ensure uniformity in data representation.

2. Neural Network Model:

> Model Selection: Choose a suitable architecture for your neural network. For example, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is often effective for image classification tasks.
> Model Design: Construct the CNN model using TensorFlow or a similar framework. Typical layers include convolutional layers, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.
Activation and Output: Use appropriate activation functions like ReLU for hidden layers and softmax for the output layer (for binary classification in this case).
3. Training:

> Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and validation sets to evaluate model performance during training.
> Model Training: Train the CNN model on the training set. Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs to optimize performance.
> Model Evaluation: Monitor the model's performance on the validation set to avoid overfitting and ensure generalization.
4. Model Evaluation and Testing:
 Testing Phase: Evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset that it hasn't seen during training to assess real-world performance.
> Performance Metrics: Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to quantify the model's effectiveness in detecting face masks.
